## Technical Requirements	

Performing - Full CRUD functionality is present on one or two models.	

Good job! I really like the theme of your app and that it fits within your interests!

## Creativity and Interface	

Progressing - The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page	

I would keep adding to the interface! I would maybe add your pictures that you have linked!

## Code Quality

Progressing/Performing - I would remove the commented code, and add more spacing. I would also .gitignore the .DS_Store files. In addition, make sure to use semantic naming, so instead of `myItems.js` `garden-tips.js` or something along those lines. Similarly, you have a class called `boo` -- instead use something like `cursive` or `header-text` that describes what the class is doing.

## Functionality

Performing - Application contains no major errors	

## Planning / Process / Submission

Performing - App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality	

I would keep adding to your readme, add most of the things in this post!
